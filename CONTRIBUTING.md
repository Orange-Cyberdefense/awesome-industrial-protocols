Contribution to the Awesome List
--------------------------------

There are two ways (described below) to suggest data changes.

- Via a Pull Request (PR) to the README.md
- By making changes to the MongoDB database

All changes to data must adhere to the following guidelines:

- Changes must include at least basic information that make the scope and the
  content of the changes clear. It is recommended to say why you suggest them.  
- Links to resources must be valid, relevant, safe and appropriate.

### Suggest changes

You can suggest changes by editing the Awesome List in `README.md` via GitHub's
web interface or via a text editor.

Submit your changes as a PR. It is recommended to add a few words to
explain why you're proposing the changes.

> If you submit a change that is accepted, please note that the project owner
  will add it to the database and not only to the Awesome List text file.

### Modify the database

*All the content from the Awesome List comes from the database. The list is*
*generated automatically from it.*

It is not recommended to do this as this is more complicated, but if you are
motivated you can update the JSON files directly in `db`.

Submit the databases `protocols.json` and `links.json` as a PR.
